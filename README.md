📊 Data Analysis Project using MySQL, Python & Power BI

This project utilizes three core technologies: MySQL, Python, and Power BI, creating a complete data analysis workflow from storage to processing and visualization. 🗄️ MySQL served as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) where structured data was stored and managed in tables. Using SQL queries, data was filtered, grouped, and joined to extract meaningful insights—such as calculating salary expenses per department, filtering HR employees, identifying high performers (score >8), and analyzing city-wise employee distribution.

🐍 Python was employed for data analysis and manipulation using powerful libraries like Pandas (data cleaning & transformation), NumPy (numerical computations), and Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations). Complex problems were solved including: calculating total sales by payment method, identifying top 5 product categories and customers based on sales, finding top 10 students by average score, comparing gender-based performance, analyzing impact of study hours on scores, and discovering subject-wise highest scorers.

📈 Power BI was used for data visualization and dashboard creation, leveraging Power Query for data cleaning and DAX for calculations and data modeling. Raw data was transformed into interactive charts, graphs, maps, and KPIs. Two main dashboards were developed:

👥 Workforce Analytics & Performance Overview Dashboard – Analysis revealed that the majority workforce is concentrated in Customer Support and Karachi region. The Accounting department achieved the highest performance scores. Leave patterns and performance variations highlighted opportunities for targeted training and workload optimization. Compensation is largely fixed salary-based, providing financial stability but potentially limiting motivation due to fewer performance-based incentives. HR expenditure is heavily Karachi-focused, indicating need for regional expansion.

☕ Coffee Sales Performance Dashboard – Detailed analysis of revenue, product mix, store contribution, and sales volume showed Coffee as the primary revenue driver, with Tea and Bakery as supporting categories. Store-level performance differences emphasized the impact of location and footfall, suggesting targeted strategies for underperforming outlets. Consistent average pricing and strong transaction volumes reflect stable demand and effective pricing policies. These insights support product portfolio optimization, inventory management, and sales growth planning.

✅ Overall Outcome: An end-to-end data analysis pipeline was successfully developed—extracting and filtering data with MySQL, cleaning and calculating with Python, and creating interactive dashboards with Power BI to deliver meaningful insights. This project demonstrates how real-world business problems can be effectively solved by combining these three technologies.
